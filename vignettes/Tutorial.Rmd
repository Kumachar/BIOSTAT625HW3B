```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,

)
```

```{r setup}
library(HW3)
```


Now we can display a simple example of how this package works. We are going to use linear model to predict the Miles per gallon based on horse power and weight of a car in mtcars data.

```{r cars}
data("mtcars")
X <- mtcars[, c("hp", "wt")]
y <- mtcars$mpg

#Construct a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict Miles per gallon based on horse power and weight of a car
model <- linear_model(X, y, intercept = TRUE)

#Now we can see the regression coefficients for each variable you use in the model
model$coefficients

#Also we can predict data based on acquired coefficients use lineaer_prediction function
head(linear_prediction(X,model$coefficients))

#There are also some useful functions to generate the result of regression 
result<-model_summary(model)

print(result)

```
